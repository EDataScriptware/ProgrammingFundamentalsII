public int fib(int n) {
    if(n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
}

This is considered a recursion example. Why?

The fib method will be kept ongoing if and only if it is greater than or equal to one or else it will return the number n that is else than zero. It's closely similar to iteration but it exactly isn't iteration in fact it is not a loop and it is handled inside a method in a different class. This could be done through iteration although some would say that the logic is flawed or missing a piece of information. For loop is typically best used to substitute a recursion.
